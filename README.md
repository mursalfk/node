## ✅ Feasibility Analysis

### 1. **Tech Stack Feasibility**

| Component              | Tool/Service        | Feasibility         |
|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Email Fetching         | IMAP + Python Email | ✅ Well-supported   |
| Backend                | Flask (REST API)    | ✅ Lightweight, Fast |
| Cloud Functions        | AWS Lambda          | ✅ Pay-as-you-go    |

### 2. **Cost Estimation (AWS Free Tier Friendly)**

| Resource            | Service     | Cost (Est.)                         |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Email Fetching      | Lambda      | Free (if ≤1M invocations/mo)       |
| File Storage        | S3          | Free up to 5GB                     |
| Backend Hosting     | EC2 / Fargate / Render | Free-tier or ~$5–10/mo |
| Step Functions      | Optional    | Pay-per-transition (~$0.025/1k)    |
| Notion API          | Free        | ✓                                  |
| Slack Webhook       | Free        | ✓                                  |

### 3. **Scalability & Maintenance**

- **Scalable**: Cloud components scale with load  
- **Low Maintenance**: Lambda/S3 handle backend heavy-lifting  
- **Modular Design**: Email fetch, notifications, and Notion sync can evolve independently  
- **CI/CD Ready**: Works well with GitHub Actions or CodePipeline

### 4. **Potential Risks & Mitigations**

| Risk                             | Mitigation                            |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Gmail IMAP quota limits          | Use App Passwords, avoid polling      |
| Notion API rate limits           | Use batching, backoff strategies      |
| Email parsing complexity         | Use regex, HTML-to-text fallback      |
| Multi-service auth/keys handling | Use AWS Secrets Manager or .env       |

### 5. **Recommendation**

✅ **Proceed with Development** — The project is feasible, affordable under AWS Free Tier, and technically scalable. Combines cloud automation, email insights, and productivity tooling into one elegant system.
